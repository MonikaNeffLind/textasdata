*[J]ust as the invention of the telescope revolutionized
the study of the heavens, so too by rendering the
unmeasurable measurable, the technological revolution
in mobile, Web, and Internet communications
has the potential to revolutionize our understanding
of ourselves and how we interact ... .
[T]hree hundred years after Alexander Pope argued
that the proper study of mankind should lie
not in the heavens but in ourselves, we have finally
found our telescope. Let the revolution begin.*  

â€”Duncan Watts (2011, p. 266)
